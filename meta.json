    "slogan": "A Free Interactive Course",
    "description": "The course is organized as a digital lecture, which should be as self-contained and enable self-study as much as possible. The major part of the material is provided as slide sets with lecture videos. We have also prepared interactive tutorials where you can answer multiple choice questions, and learn how to apply the covered methods in R on some short coding exercises. Our plan is to extend this self-study material over the next months and years.",
    "bio": "We are a big team collaboratively creating the course. Main contributors include Bernd Bischl, Fabian Scheipl, Heidi Seibold, Daniel Schalk and Christoph Molnar.",
