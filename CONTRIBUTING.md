# Contributing guide

This guide helps you to get started in working with this repo.


## ‚úÖ Quickstart

1. [Import](https://github.com/new/import) this repo, install it and make sure
   the app is running locally.
2. Customize the [`meta.json`](meta.json) and
   [`binder/install.R`](binder/install.R).
3. Build a [Binder](https://mybinder.org) from the `binder` branch of this repo.
4. Add content (chapters, exercises and slides) and optionally add separate
   content license.
5. Customize the UI theme in [`theme.sass`](theme.sass) and update images in
   [`static`](static) as needed.
6. Deploy the app, e.g. to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).


### Local Installation (on Ubuntu):

1. Install `curl` and download the latest `npm` version:

```bash 
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
```
Note that the install sktipt adds the following lines to your `.bashrc`:  

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```
If you use a different shell (`fish`, `zsh`, ...) then you have to add these files manually.

2. Set default Node.js version:

```bash       
nvm install 10
nvm use 10              
```

3. Install the Gatsby CLI:

```bash 
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

4. Create a Gatsby site:

```bash 
gatsby new local-site https://github.com/teaching-data-science/intro2ml
```

5. Change the working directory and start the development mode:

```bash 
cd local-site
gatsby develop
```

You‚Äôll be able to visit the site locally at http://localhost:8000/ for as long as your development server is running.


### Local Installation (on Windows and Mac): 
1. You may need to use `yarn` instead of `npm`:

```bash 
brew install yarn
```

2. Install the Gatsby CLI using `yarn`:

```bash 
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

3. Do the fourth and fifth steps of the local installation on ubuntu. 


## How to access different homepage parts?

![code-execution](https://github.com/teaching-data-science/intro2ml/blob/master/static/screenshot.png)

The five indicated parts can be costomized by changing the following files:

1. `static/logo.csv`

2. `src/pages/index.js`

3. `src/components/layout.js`

4. `static/profile.jpg`

5. `meta.json`


## üé® Customization

The app separates its source and content ‚Äì so you usually shouldn't have to dig
into the JavaScript source to change things. The following points of
customization are available:

| Location             | Description                                                                                                                           |

| `static`             | Static assets like images, will be copied to the root.                                                                                |

### `meta.json`

The following meta settings are available. **Note that you have to re-start
Gatsby to see the changes if you're editing it while the server is running.**

### Static assets

All files added to `/static` will become available at the root of the deployed
site. So `/static/image.jpg` can be referenced in your course as `/image.jpg`.
The following assets need to be available and can be customized:

| `icon_check.svg`  | "Check" icon displayed on "Mark as completed" button.    |
| `icon_slides.svg` | Icon displayed in the corner of a slides exercise.       |

## ‚úèÔ∏è Content

### File formats

#### Chapters

Chapters are placed in [`/chapters`](/chapters) and are Markdown files
consisting of `<exercise>` components. They'll be turned into pages, e.g.
`/chapter1`. In their frontmatter block at the top of the file, they need to
specify `type: chapter`, as well as the following meta:

```yaml
---
title: The chapter title
description: The chapter description
prev: /chapter1 # exact path to previous chapter or null to not show a link
next: /chapter3 # exact path to next chapter or null to not show a link
id: 2 # unique identifier for chapter
type: chapter # important: this creates a standalone page from the chapter
---

```

#### Slides

Slides are placed in [`/slides`](/slides) and are markdown files consisting of
slide content, separated by `---`. They need to specify the following
frontmatter block at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
type: slides
---

```

The **first and last slide** use a special layout and will display the headline
in the center of the slide. **Speaker notes** (in this case, the script) can be
added at the end of a slide, prefixed by `Notes:`. They'll then be shown on the
right next to the slides. 

### Custom Elements

When using custom elements, make sure to place a newline between the
opening/closing tags and the children. Otherwise, Markdown content may not
render correctly.

### Setting up Binder

The [`install.R`](binder/install.R) in the repository defines the packages that
are installed when building it with Binder. You can specify the binder settings
like repo, branch and kernel type in the `"juniper"` section of the `meta.json`.
I'd recommend running the very first build via the interface on the
[Binder website](https://mybinder.org), as this gives you a detailed build log
and feedback on whether everything worked as expected. Enter your repository
URL, click "launch" and wait for it to install the dependencies and build the
image.

![Binder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13643239/39412757-a518d416-4c21-11e8-9dad-8b4cc14737bc.png)

### Adding tests

To validate the code when the user hits "Submit", we're currently using a
slightly hacky trick. Since the R code is sent back to the kernel as a string,
we can manipulate it and add tests ‚Äì for example, exercise `exc_01_02_01.R` will
be validated using `test_01_02_01.R` (if available). The user code and test are
combined using a string template. At the moment, the `testTemplate` in the
`meta.json` looks like this:

```r
success <- function(text) {
    cat(paste("\033[32m", text, "\033[0m", sep = ""))
}

.solution <- "${solutionEscaped}"

${solution}

${test}
tryCatch({
    test()
}, error = function(e) {
    cat(paste("\033[31m", e[1], "\033[0m", sep = ""))
})
```

If present, `${solution}` will be replaced with the string value of the
submitted user code, and `${solutionEscaped}` with the code but with all `"`
replaced by `\"`, so we can assign it to a variable as a string and check
whether the submission includes something. We also insert the regular solution,
so we can actually run it and check the objects it creates. `${test}` is
replaced by the contents of the test file. The template also defines a `success`
function, which prints a formatted green message and can be used in the tests.
Finally, the `tryCatch` expression checks if the test function raises a `stop`
and if so, it outputs the formatted error message. This also hides the full
error traceback (which can easily leak the correct answers).

A test file could then look like this:

```r
test <- function() {
    if (some_var != length(mtcars)) {
        stop("Are you getting the correct length?")
    }
    if (!grepl("print(mtcars$gear)", .solution, fixed = TRUE)) {
        stop("Are you printing the correct variable?")
    }
    success("Well done!")
}
```

The string answer is available as `.solution`, and the test also has access to
the solution code.

### How does the repo work?

There are two branches of this repo, which are used for different tasks:

- **master** - this is what the course is served out of via netlify:
  http://r-bootcamp.netlify.com - any changes to exercises in this branch will
  show up on the netlify page. The netlify page uses a JavaScript framework
  called Gatsby to build the pages. Gatsby submits code to binder and receives
  the output. It also handles the code checking. The parts of the repo that are
  handled by Gatsby include:

1. exercises/solutions/tests
2. chapter.md files
3. slides (using reveal.js)

- **binder** - this is what the Binder image is built from. The reason they're
  different is that binder forces a Docker container rebuild when a branch is
  updated. So, if we served our container out of master, it would rebuild
  everytime we modified a `chapter.md` or an exercise. If you need to add
  packages, you will add them to the `binder/install.R` for this branch, and if
  you need to add datasets, you can add them to the `data/` folder. The parts of
  the repo handled by Binder include:

1. datasets in data/ folder (the container needs access to these to load data
   from submitted code)
2. installation instructions in the binder/ folder for installing dependencies

I would say that the easiest thing to do is to occasionally merge `master` into
`binder` when you need to update the data:

Note that rebuilding the binder container can take a little bit of time (usually
on the order of 5 or 10 minutes or so), since it is installing/compiling
`tidyverse` for the container. You can always check the build status of the
container by clicking the badge below and looking at the log.

You can view the binder container here:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/teaching-data-science/intro2ml/binder)
### Adding Packages

If you need to add packages, add the appropriate `install.packages()` statement
into `binder/install.R`. When you do, check that the container was built
properly by clicking the binder link above.
