title: 'Chapter 5.3: Growing a Tree'
description:
  ' In this Section, we explain how to grow a tree starting with an empty tree, a root node containing all the data. It will be shown that trees are grown by recursively applying greedy optimization to each node.'

Which statements about CART are true?
<choice>
<opt text="To find optimal splits, one iterates over all features, and for each feature over all possible split points." correct="true">
</opt>
<opt text="To find optimal splits, we use the one that splits the data approximately in half in each step.">
</opt>
<opt text="To find optimal splits, we evaluate the possible splits only on the data that ended up in the parent node we are trying to split." correct="true">
</opt>
<opt text="The optimal split results in the lowest sum of empirical risks in the child nodes." correct="true">
</opt>
<opt text="Monotone transformations of several features will change the structure of the tree.">
</opt>
<opt text="The CART algorithm cannot go on training if every node contains exactly one observation" correct="true">
